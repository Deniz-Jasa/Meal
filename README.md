<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Meal was a group project for my Intro. to Software Engineering course (SEG 2105) at the University of Ottawa where myself and my team was tasked to create create an app in the food delivery market. Our team quickly regonized that creating yet another food delivery app would be too repetive and vanilla. 

We noticed that popular delivery apps were already fast, accesible, and easy which is something we wanted to implement as well. However, from our personal experiences the quality was primarily fast food and unhealthy choices. Thats when we though of Meal! Meal guarantees fresh ingredients, high-quality meals, and professional chefs, making it easier for customers to access only healthier and home-cooked meals options.
