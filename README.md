<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Meal was a group project for my Introduction to Software Engineering course (SEG 2105) at the University of Ottawa where my team and I were tasked with creating an app in the food delivery market. We quickly recognized that creating yet another food delivery app would be repetitive and frankly vanilla.

We noticed that popular delivery apps were already fast, accessible, and easy, which is something we wanted to implement as well. However, from our personal experiences, the quality was primarily fast food and unhealthy choices. That's when we thought of Meal! Meal guarantees fresh ingredients, high-quality meals, and professional chefs, making it easier for customers to access healthier and home-cooked meal options only. Meal connects hungry folks with a local chef!

### Installation

Below is how to run the Meal android application locally through an emulator in Android Studio.

   ```
2. Add Configuration 
   ```sh
   Android API 22
